## Etterna Wiki

This is the Wiki for <a href="https://github.com/etternagame/etterna">Etterna</a>

It's done using gh-pages, Jekyll and a little bit of Bootstrap. It's not done using gh-wikis because having a repository allows us to control changes, have a more powerful history and get pull requests for new or edited content.


### Adding content

To add a new page just make a new .md file, and Jekyll will take care of parsing it and transforming it into an html page(Which will use the default layout).

/cpp/ contains the files for the c++ wiki, and /lua/ the ones for the lua wiki.

Both of these folders and the root folder contain a _Sidebar.md file, which is the sidebar(If you add a new page and want to add it to the sidebar, you should edit this file).
